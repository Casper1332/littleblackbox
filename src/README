LittleBlackBox requires the OpenSSL, libpcap and sqlite3 libraries. These must be installed in order to build.

When building for Linux, the default is to perform a static build. The required libraries will be built automatically:

	$ make

Mac OSX does not support static builds, so you must have these libaraies already installed:

	$ make -f Makefile.OSX

The littleblackbox binary will be installed to ../bin.
