LittleBlackBox requires the OpenSSL, libpcap, libcurl and sqlite3 libraries. These must be installed in order to build:

	$ ./configure
	$ make

If you do not have the required libraries installed, you may specify a static build and the libraries will be built into 
a local directory (not installed on the build system) and statically linked into the binary:

	$ ./configure --enable-static
	$ make

Note that static builds will not work on Mac OSX.
